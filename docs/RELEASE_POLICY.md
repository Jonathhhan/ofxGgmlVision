# Release Policy

`ofxGgmlVision` releases are tagged independently from `ofxGgmlCore` and the
other companion addons.

## Tagging

Use per-addon semantic version tags:

```text
v1.0.0
v1.0.1
v1.1.0
```

Do not mirror tags across the whole addon family unless this addon changed and
passed its own release checklist.

## Compatibility

Document the minimum compatible `ofxGgmlCore` version in each release note.

For normal development:

- patch releases should not require Core API changes
- minor releases may require a newer Core minor version
- breaking API changes should use a major version bump

## Runtime Scope

CLIP, image embedding, captioning, visual search, and VLM adapters should be
explicit about their local runtime and model requirements when they land.
Skeleton releases must say clearly when no model-backed runtime is included.

Generated models, media outputs, and build outputs stay out of git.

## Pre-Release Gate

Before tagging:

1. Run `scripts\release-candidate.bat` on Windows.
2. Run `./scripts/release-candidate.sh` on macOS or Linux when available.
3. Complete `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`.
4. Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
5. Confirm no generated artifacts, model binaries, or generated media are staged.
